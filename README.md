# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the hospitality sector for Atliq Grands. The objective was to provide data-driven insights to guide strategic decisions and improve performance in response to declining market share and revenue.

## Problem Statement
Atliq Grands, a renowned name in the luxury hotel industry in India, has been facing a decline in market share and revenue due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making. To counter this, the management decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence but lacked an in-house analytics team. Consequently, they sought insights from their historical data to guide their strategies and improve performance.

## Key Learnings
1. **Custom Visual Creation**: Developed a new Calendar visual using a matrix table to analyze various aspects effectively.
2. **Cancellation Policies**: Gained insights into industry-standard cancellation policies where most hotels charge a fee only if cancellations are made within three months of the booking date. Post this period, cancellation charges range between 60% to 90% of the booking cost.
3. **Bookmarks and Selection**: Utilized bookmarks and selection for various functionalities, such as page navigation and filter clearing within the dashboard.
4. **Color Palette Consistency**: Applied a cohesive color palette across the dashboard to maintain visual consistency.

## Significant Insights from the Dashboard
1. **Revenue Generation**:
   - Mumbai is the top revenue generator with 669 Million, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.
   - AtliQ Exotica leads among property types with 320 Million in revenue, an average rating of 3.62, an occupancy rate of 57%, and a cancellation rate of 24.4%.
2. **Occupancy and Performance**:
   - AtliQ Bay boasts the highest occupancy rate at 66%.
   - Delhi excels in both occupancy and ratings, followed closely by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
   - Week 24 emerged as the peak revenue week, bringing in 139.6 Million.
3. **Cancellation Impact**:
   - Cancellations have led to a substantial revenue loss of approximately 298 Million.
   - Elite type rooms have the highest booking rates and also the highest cancellation rates.

## Detailed Insights and Visuals
1. **Room Type Analysis**: Premium rooms have a higher booking frequency but also show a notable cancellation trend, indicating potential issues with booking policies or customer satisfaction.
2. **Revenue Trends**: Seasonal trends indicate peak booking periods align with major holidays and business events, suggesting targeted marketing strategies could enhance revenue.
3. **Customer Demographics**: Analysis of customer demographics shows a high percentage of repeat customers in Mumbai and Bangalore, highlighting the importance of loyalty programs.
